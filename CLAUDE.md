# Clustarr

A distributed, event-driven media stack for Kubernetes: controllers and CRDs that
manage a media collection end to end, from wanting something through finding,
downloading, importing, transcoding and subtitling it.

Custom resources are the interface. `kubectl get movies,downloads,transcodejobs`
is the UI, and the web UI is a view over the same resources.

## Read before designing anything

- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-18-clustarr-design.md` — the design of record.
  Field-level CRD definitions, event subjects, data flows, milestones.
- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-18-clustarr-design-amendment-1.md` — adds
  `importarr`, observability and the UI. **Where the two disagree, the amendment
  wins.**
- `docs/adr/0001..0008` — why NATS, why GPL-3.0, why Jobs for transcode, and so on.
- `docs/research/*.md` — nine verified research notes (TRaSH quality model,
  Prowlarr/Cardigann, queue comparison, torrent/usenet, controller-runtime,
  ffmpeg, Bazarr, metadata providers, naming). Long: `grep -n '^#'` first, then
  read the section. They contain verified API shapes — prefer them over guessing.

The spec is authoritative for names, fields and behaviour. Do not invent fields;
do not drop them.

## Services

One Go module, one cobra binary: `clustarr <service> --role <role>`.

| Dir | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `catalogarr/` | Media domain (movies, series, music, books, comics, audiobooks), metadata gateway, release decisions |
| `importarr/` | Everything entering the library: root-folder rescan, import lists, completed-download import |
| `indexarr/` | Indexer aggregation, Cardigann engine, local release index (SQLite FTS5) |
| `grabarr/` | Download clients: torrent (anacrolix) and usenet engines |
| `squasharr/` | Transcode to HEVC 10-bit + AAC, as batch Jobs |
| `captionarr/` | Subtitles, Bazarr-equivalent, distributed |
| `ui/` | Server-rendered web UI (templ + htmx + SSE); never writes status |

API groups: `{catalog,index,download,transcode,subtitle}.clustarr.io/v1alpha1`.
Module `github.com/mediactl/clustarr`. Licence GPL-3.0 (lets us port *arr and
Bazarr logic verbatim — keep the header on every file).

## Invariants — do not break these

- **One controller-writer per resource.** The sole exception is `MediaFile`:
  `importarr` owns what it observed (`status.file`, `status.probe`), `catalogarr`
  owns what it decided (`status.quality`, `status.formatScore`, conditions).
  Split by field manager on disjoint fields.
- **All status writes go through `pkg/k8s.PatchStatus`** (server-side apply with a
  named field manager). `.Status().Update()` and `.Status().Patch()` are banned
  outside `pkg/k8s` and golangci-lint's forbidigo rule enforces it.
- **No `float32`/`float64` in `api/`.** controller-gen rejects them without
  `allowDangerousTypes`, and floats do not round-trip across API clients. Use
  `resource.Quantity` for decimals a human types (e.g. seed ratio `"2.0"`) and
  scaled integers for machine telemetry: `Milli` (thousandths, 23.976 fps →
  `23976`), `Centis` (hundredths), `Percent` (whole 0-100).
- **Kubernetes watches are the default coupling**; NATS is the exception, for
  rate-limited or long-running work, RPC, the release firehose and KV leases.
- **Cap every status list** with `+kubebuilder:validation:MaxItems`. Unbounded
  lists in status are how operators melt etcd.
- **The scanner never guesses.** Unattributable files go to
  `LibraryScan.status.unmatched` with the reason, never a speculative item.
- **The UI never writes status** and owns no CRD. User actions patch spec or
  create short-lived resources, so anything the UI does, `kubectl` can do.

## Commands

```bash
make generate      # deepcopy + apply configurations
make manifests     # CRDs + RBAC into config/
make build         # binary into bin/  (never bare `go build` — it drops a binary in the repo root)
make test          # unit + envtest, sets KUBEBUILDER_ASSETS
make lint          # golangci-lint v2
make kind-up       # local cluster with NATS, then: make install deploy
```

Tools live in `$(go env GOPATH)/bin`: `controller-gen` v0.22.0, `setup-envtest`,
`kustomize`, `golangci-lint-v2`. envtest assets are Kubernetes 1.37.0.

## Gotchas found the hard way

- **`go test ./...` passing does not mean the CRDs are valid.** `pkg/crdcheck`
  and the envtest suites skip silently when `KUBEBUILDER_ASSETS` is unset. Only
  `make test` (or exporting the assets path) compiles the CEL rules against a real
  apiserver. A suite that finishes in milliseconds skipped.
- **controller-gen v0.22.0's `applyconfiguration` generator ignores output rules**
  — it writes next to the types regardless of `output:...:dir`. The Makefile
  documents the workaround.
- **Never run `go get` or `go mod tidy` from parallel agents.** They corrupt
  `go.mod`. Add every dependency serially up front, then tell workers not to touch
  it.
- **Use `github.com/dlclark/regexp2`, not stdlib `regexp`, for TRaSH patterns.**
  Go's RE2 rejects 157 of the 2791 custom-format regexes (backtracking,
  lookaround). Set `IgnoreCase` and a `MatchTimeout`.
- **Quality profiles are TRaSH-only and opinionated.** Built-in profiles ship as
  embedded data; custom-format editing is deliberately not exposed.

## Code conventions

- GPL-3.0 header from `hack/boilerplate.go.txt` on every Go file.
- Logging is `slog` carried through `context` (`pkg/obs/logging.FromContext`). No
  package-level logger, no logger struct fields. controller-runtime gets a
  `logr.FromSlogHandler` bridge at startup.
- Spans wrap every `Reconcile`, work handler, outbound provider call and ffmpeg
  run; propagation rides the `Clustarr-Trace` header already in `pkg/events`.
- Prometheus metrics use the `clustarr_` prefix and base units. **Never label by
  title, path or release name** — unbounded cardinality.
- Tests: table-driven, testify, fixtures under `testdata/`. Pure functions where
  the logic is tricky (`pkg/pipeline.Project`, `pkg/transcode.Plan`) so it is
  testable without a cluster.

## Status

Pre-alpha. Nothing reconciles yet.

Done: all 28 CRDs across five groups (generate cleanly, install into a real
apiserver); `pkg/events` (NATS + in-memory implementations behind one contract
suite); `pkg/k8s`; the binary and manager wiring; deployment manifests, Helm chart
and images; the ADRs.

Next, in order: M1 catalog core and library rescan → M2 indexers → M3 downloads,
import and the first UI slice → M4 transcode → M5 subtitles → M6 Prowlarr parity,
import lists and non-video inventory. Milestone detail is in the spec's §16 and
amendment §A4.
